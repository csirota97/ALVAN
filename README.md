After all dependencies are installed, run VoiceRecognition.py to take ALVAN for a whirl.

Just say his name, and he will chime up, ready to meet your every demand.

Do you need an application opened? Just say: "Open Application _______"
Do you need to look up something quickly? Just say: "Look up _______"
Do you need to send an email? Make sure you've added the contact to contacts.py first, and then say: "Send email" and it will walk you through the rest!

Do you have a condition that makes using a mouse or keyboard difficult?
You can type anything by just saying: "Type _________" and like magic, it will appear
You can also scroll around pages by telling him to scroll in any direction!
If you need to move the mouse but you don't want to reach your arm out, simply say enter mouse mode and you will unlock a secret menu. If you want to hit the enter key, just say, "hit enter" as its own command.

When in mouse mode, you can say the keyword "position" and then say two numbers, 0-100. The first number is the x coordinate from left to right, and the second number is the y coordinate, from top to bottom of the screen.
For example, if I want my mouse to be in the exact middle of the screen, I could say:
    >position
    >50 and 50

But most people don't have 100x100 grids overlayed onto their screen, so your estimates might not always be correct. For those cases, instead of giving two numbers, just say what your direction, and how many ticks you would like to move the mouse. For example, I could say:
    >position
    >up 3
and the mouse would move up 3 ticks.

Once your cursor is in the right place, just tell it to click, right click, double click, or double right click. I don't really care what you do.

To exit mouse mode, just say "exit" and you will be returned back to the main menu.

Would you like to hear a joke? Try asking to hear one. Unfortunately ALVAN is still in comedian school, so he only knows, a few, but he is working hard to learn some more.

If you are done with ALVAN and would like to end his assistance, the command to shut him down is:
"Kill Yourself".
